USE sql_store;


SELECT * 
FROM customers
-- WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY first_name;

SELECT first_name , points
FROM customers;


SELECT first_name , points , points * 10
FROM customers;

Arithmetic poerators

*, / , + , - , %

(* and /  have higher precedence , () can be used to override)

SELECT first_name , points , points * 10 AS discount_price
FROM customers; 

SELECT first_name , points , points * 10 AS 'discount price' 
FROM customers; (within quotes when space is available)

SELECT DISTINCT state FROM customers; (only unique value returned)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE points > 3000;

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE state='VA'; (either single or double quotes for string)

Comparison operators
>
<
>=
<=
=
for not equal to either != or <>

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE birth_date  > '1990-01-01' (date in year-month-date format)

Logical Operators
AND
OR
NOT

(Predence AND , OR in order - () can be added to override)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE birth_date  > '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE NOT (birth_date  > '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000)


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE  state ='VA'OR state='FL';

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE  state IN('VA','FL')

Above both are same

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 and 3000 (includes 1000 and 3000, logical operators can be used as an alternative)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2020-01-01'

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%' (last_name starts with b and any number of characters further)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE '%b%' (character b in last name)


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE '%y' (ends with character y in last name)


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Nase_y' (_ for any single character at that place)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Nas__y'

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name LIKE '%field';

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field'

Above both are same (give same results)

REGEXP is more powerful when comes to string


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '^field'; (starts with field)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field$' (ends with field)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e';
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field|mac' (contains field or mac in name)


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'e'; (contains e)


SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gmd]e'; (either ge, me or de in last_name)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e'; (a to h before e)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE phone IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;

SELECT customer_id,first_name FROM sql_store.customers
ORDER BY first_name;

SELECT customer_id,first_name,state  FROM sql_store.customers
ORDER BY state, first_name; (first order with state done and then the first name)

SELECT customer_id,first_name,state, 10 as marks  FROM sql_store.customers
ORDER BY state, first_name; (one more column named marks with value 10 displayed)

SELECT customer_id,first_name,state, 10 as marks  FROM sql_store.customers
ORDER BY state DESC, first_name DESC; (in descending order - both state and first_name)

SELECT * FROM sql_store.order_items
WHERE order_id=2 
ORDER BY quantity * unit_price DESC;

SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS 'total price' FROM sql_store.order_items
WHERE order_id=2 
ORDER BY quantity * unit_price DESC;


SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS 'total price' FROM sql_store.order_items
WHERE order_id=2 
ORDER BY 'total price' DESC;

Above two statements give same result

SELECT * from customers
LIMIT 3; (first three rows)

SELECT * from customers
LIMIT 6,3 (offset 6 and then read 3 rows)

SELECT * from customers
WHERE points > 2500
ORDER BY points DESc
LIMIT 3

SELECT * 
FROM orders
JOIN customers
	 ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id (first columns from orders and then customers are displayed)

Joins - helps to display columns from multiple tables.
        helps to display columns from multiple database
SELECT * 
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	 ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id (with alias name - by default its inner join)

SELECT order_id, o.customer_id,last_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	 ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id

Joining different database

SELECT * 
FROM order_items oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products p
	ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

self join (join with same table)

SELECT * 
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
     ON e.reports_to=m.employee_id

SELECT e.employee_id,e.first_name,m.first_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
     ON e.reports_to=m.employee_id

SELECT e.employee_id,e.first_name,m.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
     ON e.reports_to=m.employee_id

Join multiple tables

SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_statuses os
    ON o.status= os.order_status_id

SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.first_name,c.last_name,os.name AS status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_statuses os
    ON o.status= os.order_status_id

Composite primary key- Having more than one column as primary key (eg:- order_id and product_id in order_items table)
Compound join condition (mutiple columns used to uniquely identify, otherwise duplicated).

SELECT * 
FROM order_items oi
JOIN order_item_notes oin
  ON oi.order_Id = oin.order_Id 
  AND oi.product_id = oin.product_id (no matching rows found)
